Run trunk/ext/qtpropertybrowser_update.sh script first to download and compile
Qt Property Browser component.

Full recompilation can be done by running trunk/REBUILD.sh.

Developers who wanna add new source files must not modify project files by hand.
These are generated automatically using mid9th toolbox.
Run trunk/ext/mid9th_toolbox_update.sh script first to download/update scripts
AutoQMake.sh and template.sh.

To generate new source files from templates (examples are in trunk/prj/) go
into the trunk/src folder, run ../ext/template.sh script and follow usage hint.
  e.g. generate a class XYZ with public header in component sfd::gui::validator:
    ../ext/template.sh ../prj public sfd::gui::validator::XYZ

To (re)generate project files from all available sources, resources, etc. go
into the trunk/src folder, run ../ext/AutoQMake.sh script and follow usage hint.
Most probably you wanna run:
    ../ext/AutoQMake.sh sfd

Extra component dependecies and other project related stuff can be configured
via AutoQMake.cfg file that should be created in the component folder.
Look for existing AutoQMake.cfg files to see the syntax.
